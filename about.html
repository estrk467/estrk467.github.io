	<hr class= "new1"> 
	<p> Hi! I'm Karla. I am a recent graduate from California State University, East Bay. I majored in Computer Science and I am currently in the process of looking for a full time job. I'm a first-generation student and I could not be more proud of myself for being able to complete my degree this Spring. It was tough journey but I am glad I was able to commit to it. I learned a lot during my years in school and I am excited to get to use the tech skills I learned in my classes. </p>
	<p> Currently, I have a fellowship with my county, Santa Clara County in California. It is a fellowship design for DACA recipients to advance their leadership and professionals skills while serving the immigrant community of Santa Clara County. As an undocumented student, it is very important for me to be part of my community and help people that have my same background. It is tough being an immigrant in the United States but even tougher when you are undocumented. I am lucky enough to be a DACA reciepient because that means I get to have a work permit and be exempt from deportation. This fellowship means a lot to me because I am able to help the people that are not as lucky as I am and I'm also surrounded by like-minded people that believe that we have a responsibility to pay it forward and advocate for the ones that don't have opportunites.</p>
